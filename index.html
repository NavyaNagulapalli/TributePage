	<p>On the World Wide Web’s 30th birthday, i.e., on March 12, 2019, Sir Tim Berners-Lee reflects on how the web has changed our world and what we must do to build a better web that serves all of humanity.
        </p>
	<blockquote>
		"Against the backdrop of news stories about how the web is misused, it’s understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30. If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web."
